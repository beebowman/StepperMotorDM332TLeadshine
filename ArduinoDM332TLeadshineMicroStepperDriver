//WIRING: 
//Connect Red wire of NEMA23 motor to A+ on the DM332T Stepping driver 
//Connect Green wire of NEMA23 motor to A- on the DM332T Stepping driver 
//Connect Yellow wire of NEMA23 motor to B+ on the DM332T Stepping driver 
//Connect Blue wire of NEMA23 motor to B- on the DM332T Stepping driver 
//Connect Pin ~9 of Arduino to PUL on the DM332T Stepping driver 
//Connect Pin 8 of Arduino to DIR on the DM332T Stepping Driver
//Connect Pin 7 of Arduino to ENA on the DM332T Stepping Driver
//Connect Red (+) of Power Supply to +Vdc on the DM332T Stepping Driver
//Connect Black (-) of Power Supply to GND on the DM332T Stepping Driver

//TIPS: 
//Use digilent screwdriver to screw/unscrew the terminal blocks on the DM332T to connect jumper wires 
//Use a power jack to 2 terminal block connector/adapter to connect jumper wires to your power supply  

//TROUBLESHOOTING: 
//If motor is not moving, ensure the green indicator is turned on for the DM332T PWR. If it isn't, there's an issue with your power supply. Also check the Pulse/rev, your motor might just be turning super slow.  
//If motor is only moving in one direction, check wiring connection to ENA. If that still doesn't work, change the signal sent from HIGH to LOW to the ENA from Arduino pin 7. 
//The DM332T instruction manual is confusing regarding ENA; for Arduino, the ENA should be connected to an Arduino pin set to HIGH (+5V) in order for the motor to switch directions using the DIR pin

  Serial.begin(9600);

  delayMicroseconds(500); //wait (pause) for 500 microseconds 
  for(x=0;x<80;x++) //this loop dictates the distance it travels (or maybe the time that it travels??)

  {
    digitalWrite(9,HIGH); //pulse (move) the motor 
    delayMicroseconds(500); //wait (pause) for 500 microseconds 

    digitalWrite(9,LOW); //stop the motor 
    delayMicroseconds(500); //wait (pause) for 500 microseconds 

  }
